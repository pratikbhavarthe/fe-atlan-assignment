# AI MODELS HUB MARKETPLACE

## SUMMARY
This platform serves as a dynamic marketplace for models, offering users the ability to peruse a wide array of models tailored to various purposes. Users can refine their search using tags, designate favorite models for easy reference, uncover top-performing models, and actively contribute to the platform by uploading their own creations.

## TECH-STACK
The project is developed using **React** for the front end and employs **Node.js** as the server for data hosting. It incorporates essential plugins and packages, including:

React Router Dom
React Hot Toast
Express Js
Tailwind CSS
Tag-Cloud
Lucide React

## ENHANCEMENT APPROACH
I haven't stored any static data such as a list of models on the client side. Instead, all data is retrieved from the Node.js server, hosted on DigitalOcean. Additionally, I've integrated **Lazy Loading** on the main Explore Page to fetch only the necessary data, thereby reducing the overall load on the user's device.
